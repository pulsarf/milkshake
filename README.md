My first (and most likely last) attempt at making minecraft cheats

Made in 2 weeks, because I had nothing useful to do

This repo is more of a showcase of my huge failure, and here are the reason why I'm not continuing this


- Bad ClickGUI components implementation. Each component knows about each other's existence
- Hardcoding of almost every feature
- Reflect API abuse
- Lack of knowledge on how to work with 3D

If somebody wishes to help me turning this failure into a complete project, reach out to me - I'll be glad to cooperate
